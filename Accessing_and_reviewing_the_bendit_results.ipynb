However, accessing that collected data may not be obvious to the uninitiated. This notebook covers what the 'realistic' pipeline [here](index.ipynb) produces and how to access it. Furthermore, it touches on how to use Jupyter/Python to conveniently view and further process all the data.\n",

Therefore, if you just plugged your sequences into the demo pipeline, you should be able to follow along to get the bendIt results for all you data.
