# Get bendit

git clone https://github.com/r78v10a07/bendit.git

#For release archive (unlike goghugo releases) could have used following
# based on https://stackoverflow.com/a/23164066/8508004 . The trick is 
# need to add `-s` option to curl!!! To handle certificates I think
# curl -sL -o thedl.tar.gz https://github.com/r78v10a07/bendit/archive/1.0.tar.gz
# tar xzf thedl.tar.gz 
# -OR COULD JUST DO download and tar in one step using pipe.
# curl -sL https://github.com/r78v10a07/bendit/archive/1.0.tar.gz | xz
# HOWEVER, USING GIT TO STICK TO THE REPO SO ID UPDATED WITHOUT A RELEASE
# I HAVE LATEST. Plus don't need to determine the version using git in the master branc.

# Compile bendit
cd bendit
make


# Add bendIt to the path
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
# to create alias for bendIt ("~/.local/bin" is in the PATH)
cd ~/.local/bin

# Add in ipywidgets extension so Halo works in notebook
# Adding and enabling ipywidgets based on https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyter-extension/commit/63bd1a323a4bacead2afbfb3522f8053ffc39250
# with an update to the jupyterlab install step, see https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_install.html#installing-the-jupyterlab-extension,
# since I am using JupyterLab latest which is now ay 2.0.1. at present (it was 1.2.6 for most of development time; updated to 2.0.1 when Jupytext and 
# Jupyter-archive both started complaining/breaking around same time & clearly in https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/releases/tag/1.4.0 it says JupyterLab 1.x 
# isn't compatible with latest and even though jupytext command line worked still, I thought Jupyter-archive breaking might be fixed by bumping to 2.01.
# and it seemed it did; had to speccify `jupyterlab>=2.0.1` in requierments because despite 2.0.1 being out with `jupyterlab>=1.2.4` it wasn't updating
# until changed), and not 0.38 which the binder example uses (STILL??). 
# Realized Halo needs ipywidgets from

# Upon addition of Jupytext, I was seeing it want to build when session launched. Seems

# >"The Jupytext extension for JupyterLab is bundled with Jupytext. Installing Jupytext will trigger a build of JupyterLab the next time you open it. If you prefer, you can trigger the build manually with `jupyter lab build`"
# Trying that here to avoid it later showing pop-up about it.
