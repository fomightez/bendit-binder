    "# Basics of using bendIt running here\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook just illustrates the basics of using bendIt on the command line in this environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook in which active sessions start with [here](bendit-index.ipynb) is meant to illustrate a realistic pipeline using `bendIt` in conjunction with the Jupyter environment. That is meant to give a taste of what is possible by having the command line version of `bendIt` alongside Jupyter environemnt while providng a basis for adapting your own pipelines. However, you may be familiar with bendIt on the command line already and wondering how to use it in Jupyter in the browser. This is meant to help with that. Plus, it could be useful for those looking to understand why I insist adding in taking advatage in Jupyter makes things better because in this example we'll keep use of things beyond the command line `bendIt` minimal.\n",

    "        <li>While a cell is running a <b>*</b> appears in the square brackets next to the cell. Once the cell has finished running the asterisk will be replaced with a number.</li>\n",
