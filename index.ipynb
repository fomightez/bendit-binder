    "This notebook will illustrate a realistic workflow where a number of sequences in a multi-sequence fasta file are analyzed with `bendIt`.  This should serve to show the advantage of using the standalone version of bend.it over [the bend.it Server](http://pongor.itk.ppke.hu/dna/bend_it.html#/bendit_form) for processing more than a few sequences, and touch upon some of the benefits of having `bendIt` working in the Jupyter environment.\n",
